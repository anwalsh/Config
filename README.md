# Configuration Files

Here are my configuration files associated with my daily workflows and tooling. These configs are mainly tested on MacOS ecosystems but historically have worked for Linux systems with minimal effort. Use at your own risk.

# Management

I have shifted recently to using Ansible for deploying and configuring my machines. As of now the Ansible method only supports MacOSX as I haven't deployed a Linux machine for Personal use recently. That will change - once it does the Ansible roles will be updated accordingly.

# Use

The entry point is `./ansible/bin/dots` for purely the Ansible side.
    -
```shell
./ansible/bin/dots

```
This script will then prompt for the become password (sudo) once the playbook begins execution. To edit what roles are applied please review `./group_vars/all.yml`.

# Package Management

Homebrew is the package manager of choice on MacOSX.
